# ðŸ”µ Considerations for Differentiating Data

## ðŸ”· Real time problems
In real time problems, for example a rocket flying through air, you'll not have access to a future point $f(t + \Delta t)$, this makes impossible to use forward difference and central difference schemes. The only option for cases like this is to use **backward difference**, even though it's less efficient. 
## ðŸ”· Lack of points
Another problem is for finite historical data, when you have all data at once, but it is limited. This means that, on the first point you won't be able to use backwards difference (and central difference) and on the last point you wont be able to use forward difference (and central difference). 
- A solution is to use forward difference in the first data point, central difference in the middle, and backward difference for the last point. 

# ðŸ”µ Differentiating Data
We have a set of measurements (data)

And from those we can construct a scatter plot

The idea is to find the derivative of these points. Since we're limited by the amount of data, which is limited by itself, a general algorithm for differentiating data would look something like:

- Forward difference at $x_1$
- Central difference from $x_2$ to $x_{N-1}$ 
- Backward difference at $x_N$

Since we don't actually have the function defined, instead of calculating $f(x)$ in our algorithm, we'll use the respective $f_i$ value in the dataset.
