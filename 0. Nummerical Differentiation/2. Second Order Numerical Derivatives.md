# ðŸ”µ Second Derivative
The second derivative is mathematically defined as
$$\frac{d^2f}{dt^2} = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f'(t + \Delta t) - f'(t)}{\Delta t}$$
The approximation is then
$$\frac{d^2f}{dt^2} \approx \frac{f'(t + \Delta t) - f'(t)}{\Delta t}$$
There are two possible paths to arrive at a second order derivative approximation:
1. Substitute one of first order derivative approximation scheme (forward, backward, central, second central, etc.) on the derivatives of the second derivative definition
2. Use a Taylor series to try to cancel as many terms as possible, except for the second derivative $f''(t)$. 

#### Central Taylor series approximation
Start by considering
$$\displaylines{
f(t + \Delta t) = f(t) + \Delta t f'(t) + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2!}f''(t) + \frac{\Delta t^3}{3!}f'''(t) + ...\\
f(t - \Delta t) = f(t) - \Delta t f'(t) + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2!}f''(t) - \frac{\Delta t^3}{3!}f'''(t) + ...}$$
We want the odd terms to cancel out, we can then do:
$$f(t+\Delta t) + f(t - \Delta t) = 2f(t) + \Delta t^2f''(t) + ... + O(\Delta t^4)$$
Isolating the $f''(t)$ term we get:
$$f''(t) = \frac{f(t - \Delta t) + 2f(t) + f(t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t^2} + O(\Delta t^2)$$
Thus, the second order approximation is
$$\boxed{\frac{d^2f}{dt^2} = \frac{f(t - \Delta t) + 2f(t) + f(t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t^2}}$$
And the error is of the order
$$\boxed{\text{Error} =  O(\Delta t^2)}$$

**OBS**: The same pattern of using a Taylor series to derive an approximation for a derivative, can be used to derive an approximation to a n order derivative.
